Adult oysters n=3 (191.93 g+/- 56.45) (Mean +/- SD) were anesthetized by overnight holding in tanks (6L) with MgCl2 (50g/l).  The following day, mantle tissue was taken and placed at -80C and oysters placed back into seawater. After 7 days, oysters were subjected to a 40C, 1 hour acute heat shock.  Tissue samples were taken immediately following heat shock exposure placed at -80C.
